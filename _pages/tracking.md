## 9-17-20

THURSDAY

ISL: Intro to BOOSTING!! It's just like bagging, except it learns from itself. It takes what it learned from the first "bag" and makes a more intelligent second tree (and so forth)

UJS: Mock Interview with Pat and Priority Queues

UWD: More [github learnning!](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)

WEDNESDAY

ISL: Intro to BOOSTING!! It's just like bagging, except it learns from itself. It takes what it learned from the first "bag" and makes a more intelligent second tree (and so forth)

UJS: DIY BubbleUp (as part of my DIY Priority Queue)

UWD: More [github learnning!](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) "Branch early, branch often." A Branch is simply a pointer to a specific commit. There is no storage or memory overhead when branching!!

## 9-14-20

MONDAY

ISL: Wrapping up bagging -- we get LOO (Leave One Out) Cross-Validation for free!! Because when we are bootstrapping, we are leaving out 1/3 of the data... so we can get LOOCV "for free" by gathering all of the instance where our observation isn't in the training data and average THAT!

UJS: A priority queue is a CONCEPT. It can be implemented as a list but this is inefficient. It should be implemented as a heap!

UWD: `github/gitignore` is a great resource for what to include in a git ignore

LHTL: Metaphors and analogies are very important -- the stranger and more memorable the better! They help us turn abstract things and things we cannot see (like bonds between chemical elements) into tangible, memorable things. Remember the monkeys and the benzine ring!

## 8-31-20

MONDAY!!

ISL: Interview with Professor's Professor! One of the first people to use k-d trees for learning purposes!! (Trees are NOT good for small samples of social data, but they are good for learning and pattern recognition!)

UJS: Had to backtrack to Priority Queues which is part of the Binary Heaps section as it's a prerequisite to the Graph Searching algorithms!

UWD: uwd-mailchimp is successfully POSTing to the mailchimp API!!

LHTL: Memory palaces -- it is OK if in the beginning, creating mental images is challenging

VG: Working on Compensation and Gender

## 8-18-20

--
ISL: CH7 -- Started Chapter 7 R markdown in R Studio, used the lm function which stands for "linear model"

UJS: S27 -- Continued working on graphs. Did depth first search algorithm in both python and javascript using only his pseudocode (not simply copying what he did)

UWD: S20 -- API practice! Starting to use API keys and getting a better understanding of how to read the query string. All stuff I've used before many times without fully understanding what's happening behind the scenes. Additionally, started a better introduction to Postman which I'm excited about!

LHTL: WK2 -- Chunking! The importance of using RECALL (like I'm trying to do right now) to solidify the information you just learned. How testing yourself is one of the best things you can do. The Einstellung Effect is where you are so intrenched in an idea or field of study that it's hard to think creatively and find new and different ways to solve problems.

CM: Not today

VG: Compensation. Using Groupby to see gender impact

UMJS: Not today

SCRIVENER: Added "You accidentally gave him your number"
