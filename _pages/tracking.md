ISL: CH7 -- Started Chapter 7 R markdown in R Studio, used the lm function which stands for "linear model"

UJS: S27 -- Continued working on graphs. Did depth first search algorithm in both python and javascript using only his pseudocode (not simply copying what he did)

UWD: S20 -- API practice! Starting to use API keys and getting a better understanding of how to read the query string. All stuff I've used before many times without fully understanding what's happening behind the scenes. Additionally, started a better introduction to Postman which I'm excited about!

LHTL: WK2 -- Chunking! The importance of using RECALL (like I'm trying to do right now) to solidify the information you just learned. How testing yourself is one of the best things you can do. The Einstellung Effect is where you are so intrenched in an idea or field of study that it's hard to think creatively and find new and different ways to solve problems.
