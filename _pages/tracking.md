ISL: The Support Vector Classifier can take advantage of "soft margins" which are helpful in terms of noise. Adding "soft margins" to our hyperplanes reduces the standard error. But we need to make sure this comes at a cost.

### TUESDAY

ISL: Separating HyperPlanes -- Hyperplanes in 2D are just lines. But, if there are multiple lines that can separate our two classes, how can we choose the best one? We use the `Maximal Margin Classifier` which essentially finds the line where there is the MAXIMUM MARGIN (the biggest space) of differences between the two classes.

ISL: Finished the CH9 coding and IT WORKS!! Now, just need to figure out what it is doing :)

UJS: Leetcode -- Add Two. My first leetcode with LinkedLists and I'm embarrassed to admit it took me a little bit to understand what was actually getting passed to the function. It looked like `11` and `12` but really it was a lowercase L and `1` and `2` -- yep. I felt dumb.

ISL: Trees summation -- simple trees are great for readability and interpretability. Unfortunately, bad at predictability. RF, bagging and bootstrapping help trees become better at prediction, but at the cost of interpretability.

UJS: DIY BubbleUp (as part of my DIY Priority Queue)

UWD: More [github learnning!](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) "Branch early, branch often." A Branch is simply a pointer to a specific commit. There is no storage or memory overhead when branching!!

## 9-14-20

MONDAY

ISL: Wrapping up bagging -- we get LOO (Leave One Out) Cross-Validation for free!! Because when we are bootstrapping, we are leaving out 1/3 of the data... so we can get LOOCV "for free" by gathering all of the instance where our observation isn't in the training data and average THAT!

UJS: A priority queue is a CONCEPT. It can be implemented as a list but this is inefficient. It should be implemented as a heap!

UWD: `github/gitignore` is a great resource for what to include in a git ignore

LHTL: Metaphors and analogies are very important -- the stranger and more memorable the better! They help us turn abstract things and things we cannot see (like bonds between chemical elements) into tangible, memorable things. Remember the monkeys and the benzine ring!

UJS: S27 -- Continued working on graphs. Did depth first search algorithm in both python and javascript using only his pseudocode (not simply copying what he did)

UWD: S20 -- API practice! Starting to use API keys and getting a better understanding of how to read the query string. All stuff I've used before many times without fully understanding what's happening behind the scenes. Additionally, started a better introduction to Postman which I'm excited about!

LHTL: WK2 -- Chunking! The importance of using RECALL (like I'm trying to do right now) to solidify the information you just learned. How testing yourself is one of the best things you can do. The Einstellung Effect is where you are so intrenched in an idea or field of study that it's hard to think creatively and find new and different ways to solve problems.
