# UNIT 4 | Market Risk

## 4.1: Readings

## 4.2: Exercise: Imagine This

Video: 5min

### EXERCISE

Suppose you are in charge of the project to manage the contracting for electricity and steel at your specialty steel company. Your company and industry have traditionally used tolling agreements to manage the steel-power spread, both from power input and steel output points of view.

1. Look up a tolling agreement and summarize its main components
2. What are the input and output decisions in this kind of agreement?

---

INPUT: Electrons
OUTPUT: Steel
Transformation rate at an agreed cost
Things we need to know for this agreement:

1. Prices of Power and Steel
2. Cost of transformation

NOTES:
-- All of the agreed to things are called "Real Options"

#### OUTCOMES THIS WEEK:

1. Measure risk using historical and parametric appraches
2. Interpret results relative to business decisions
3. Visualize Market Risk

#### We will use:

-- fitdistr()
-- Moments (? MOM)

## 4.3: Exercise: History Speaks

Video: 9 min

### EXERCISE

Now letâ€™s really explore this data. The library psych has a prefabricated scatter plot???histogram matrix we can use. With this composite plot, we examine historical relationships between the two risk factors as well as the shape of the risk factors themselves. We can also use this device to look at dependent simulations. After the scatter plots, we then look at the time series plots of the two factors.

## 4.4: Exercise: Now to the Matters at Hand

Video: 17 min

## 4.5: Exercise: Carl Freidrich Gauss, I presume

## 4.6: Exercise: Let's Go to Extremes

## 4.7: All Together Now

## 4.8: The Wrap

- Filtering
- Data Frames
- Simulation
- Math to R translation
- Graphics
- Normal and GPD distributions
- VaR and ES (Value at Risk, Expected Shortfall)
- Loss distributions and mean over loss

## QUESTIONS:

- ELI-lemonade stand: Value at Risk, Expected Shortfall

### Pivot Tables

1a. Read CSV
_The str() function allows us to see all of the objects in CreditCard_
NOTE: If it's in a data frame, we can subset it!
